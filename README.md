Simple JS game that I developed (on codepen) in my free time during an internship, now uploaded to github. Infrequent
updates, given that I'm developping it in my free time. :)

TO DO:
*******

Development wise:
    
    1) monster-tank collision detection loop => game over. Implement lives (currently the player loses
    because lives go down immediately/no restart of tank position after a collision).

Bugs:
    
    1) the blocks come in groups of three that are too far apart => make it more smooth and regular
    
    2) Currently, if the tank touches the blocks sideways and not head first => game over. Maybe better to just stop the
    tank from moving further along sideways (& game over only if head-first collision)?
